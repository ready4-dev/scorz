Description: Modules from the readyforwhatsnext youth mental health
    economic model (https://readyforwhatsnext.org/) that can be used to
    summarise multiple questionnaire responses in a single index measure.
    This package uses publicly available scoring algorithms to calculate
    health utility from multi-attribute utility instruments and has been
    developed with the ready4 framework (https://www.ready4-dev.com/).
    This development version of the scorz package has been made available
    as part of the process of testing and documenting the package.  If you
    have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
