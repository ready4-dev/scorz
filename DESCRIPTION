Description: Tools to summarise questionnaire responses from youth mental
    health collections in a single index measure.  The main motivation for
    this package is to facilitate automated scoring, using published
    publicly available scoring algorithms, of measures relevant to mental
    health systems models.  This development version of the scorz package
    has been made available as part of the process of testing and
    documenting the package.  If you have any questions, please contact
    the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
