Description: Modules from the ready4 youth mental health economic model
    (https://www.ready4-dev.com/docs/model/) that can be used to summarise
    multiple questionnaire responses in a single index measure.  This
    package uses publicly available scoring algorithms to calculate health
    utility from multi-attribute utility instruments and has been
    developed with the ready4 framework (https://www.ready4-dev.com/).
    This development version of the scorz package has been made available
    as part of the process of testing and documenting the package.  If you
    have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
