The [ready4 framework modules](https://www.ready4-dev.com/docs/framework/implementation/modularity/) in scorz are designed to make it easier to score items in datasets used in the [the readyforwhatsnext youth mental health economic model](https://readyforwhatsnext.org/) (or any other model developed with the [ready4 framework](https://www.ready4-dev.com)).

This development version of the scorz package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. 

A brief overview of the intended use of `scorz` classes and methods is available in the following articleS:

- [Score AQoL-6D (Adolescent) Health Utility](V_01.html)
- [Score EQ-5D Health Utility](V_02.html)
